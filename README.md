A Time Series Based Forecasting Model for prediction of subsequent values of Pressure was developed.
Performed Statistical tests like Ducky-Fuller and KPSS for checking the presence of non-stationarity in the series.
Since the series was sinusoidal upward treding log transformation followed by Differencing Method was applied.The resultant series turned into stationary and well set for Modelling.
Finally, I built the forecasting methods like AR, MA, ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integral Moving Average) with tuned parameters from Auto-Correlation function(ACF) and Partial Auto-Correlation function(PACF).
Best approach(ARIMA) for this dataset returned RMSE of 0.015.
